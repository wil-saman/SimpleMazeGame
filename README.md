***

The purpose of this game is for the main character go through a maze and parkour map a fast as possible.
<br />
<br />These are the characters or actors used for the project :

### BaseCharacter :

Base character is the character created for the players to control. 
It give the player a first person perspective to give the player ability to look around, move, and jump around the map. 
I also added the player the ability to run the code when the character enter a certain location.

### BasePawn :

Base Pawn is referenced from Week 1 and Week 2 tutorial from CloudDeakin. 
This class is used to create all the mesh in the map such as walls, obstacles, and floors. It borrowed all its component from StaticMeshComponent.

### Countdown :

This class is used for the countdown that starts at the beginning of the map.

### MazeSwitch :

Mazeswitch is used to destroy an object when a player gets near them. This will be used at the end of the maze to open the way for players to go to the next stage.
